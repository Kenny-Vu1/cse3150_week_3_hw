# CSE3150: Hw03
## Explaination of Concepts Used
- Null pointer
 - Used nullptr as a placeholder before the pointer was assigned
- Const
 - const was used in function arguments to ensure they would not be altered
- References
 - references was used in the function arguments, they help save computing power since they don't copy the list over, they pass by reference
- Casting
 - Casting was used to cast a string in C++ to be a string in C so it would fit the given function arguments for the assignment
- Exceptions/ control flow
 - Exceptions change the control flow if the capacity is met in addStudent
